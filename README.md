# Blackjack in Python
Matt Sakiyama

This is a text-based command line blackjack game coded in Python. To play, download blackjack.py to your device. Then, navigate in your terminal to the folder that contains the file and run:

python blackjack.py   

At the beginning of each new round, place a bet. Your goal is for the sum of the cards in your hand to be closer to 21 than the dealer's hand, without exceeding 21. Cards 2 through 9 are worth their assigned values, while 10 and the face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are all worth 10. Aces can be worth either 1 or 11, depending on your hand.

After your original two-card hand is dealt, you will have the option to "hit," receive a new card, or "stand," leave your hand as is. If at any point the sum of the cards in your hand exceeds 21, you "bust," or lose. The same is true for the dealer.

You will start with 100 chips in your stack; try to accumulate as many chips as you can.
